Pipe Dream lets you build web applications from minimal input. By using a concept of a sketch, an application schema is generated and feed through a set of pipes to create all the files needed.

## Installation

```bash
composer require --dev pipe-dream/laravel
```

Thats it, now open your browser and go to `/pipe-dream` and start designing.

## Usage
If you havent already, watch the 2 minute video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doUlmZdvP1o).

* List your models and tables in the sketch window. Note the schema automatically created to the right.
